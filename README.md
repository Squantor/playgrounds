# Playground
This repository is a playground of various experiments and try outs that I want to keep. It might build, it might not.
## Structure
* [electronics](electronics/README.md) contains all the electronic hardware used in the project.
* [software](software/README.md) contains all kinds of little software programs supported by a multi build makefile.
* [mechanical](mechanical/README.md) contains all the CAD drawings, mostly 3d printable objects.
* [firmware](firmware/README.md) contains firmware related programs for various microcontrollers supported by a multi project build makefile.
* [standalone software](standalone_software/README.md) contains little separate programs with their own makefiles
## Cloning
This repository makes extensive use of submodules, use ```git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Squantor/generic_project_template.git``` to clone everything in one go.

# Standalone software projects
Every directory contains a small selfcontained program written in C/C++ supported by its own makefile.
## Projects
This is not an exhaustive list:
* [template](template.c90/README.md) template project written in C90
* [Minunit for C90](minunit.c90/README.md) unittest framework template that should work on any C90 compliant compiler
* [LFSR Hasher](LFSR_hash.c90/README.md) is a simple hashing program using a 64 bit LFSR to quickly hash files. Experiment to see if quick hashes can be made on a 8088 processor.
